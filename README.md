Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

Total No. of entries – 1599 observation
- Fixed.acidity : are non-volatile acids that do not evaporate readily
- Volatile.acidity : are high acetic acid in wine which leads to an unpleasant
vinegar taste
- Citric.acid : acts as a preservative to increase acidity (small quantities add
freshness and flavour to wines.
- Residual.sugar : is the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation
stops. The key is to have a perfect balance between — sweetness and
sourness (wines > 45g/litres are sweet)
- Chlorides : the amount of salt in the wine
- Free.sulfur.dioxide : it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of
wine
- Total.sulfur.dioxide : is the amount of free + bound forms of SO2
- PH : the level of acidity
- Sulphates: a wine additive that contributes to SO2 levels and acts as an
antimicrobial and antioxidant
- Alcohol: the amount of alcohol in wine
- Quality: the numeric label indicating quality of the wine sample ranging
from 3 to 8.
- Density: sweeter wines have a higher density

## Algorithms used:
- Random Forest Classifier
- SVM

## Conclusion
In this project we have successfully implemented Wine Quality Prediction using
Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine Algorithm. Random
forest classifier and the support vector machine predict the quality of wine for a
record sample and determine which factor contributes maximum to the
prediction respectively. One of the biggest advantages of random forest is its
versatility. It can be used for both regression and classification tasks, and it's
also easy to view the relative importance it assigns to the input features.Support
vector machine works comparably well when there is an understandable margin
of dissociation between classes. It is more productive in high dimensional
spaces. It is effective in instances where the number of dimensions is larger than
the number of specimens.
