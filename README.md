Total No. of entries – 1599 observation
Fixed.acidity : are non-volatile acids that do not evaporate readily
Volatile.acidity : are high acetic acid in wine which leads to an unpleasant
vinegar taste
Citric.acid : acts as a preservative to increase acidity (small quantities add
freshness and flavour to wines.
Residual.sugar : is the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation
stops. The key is to have a perfect balance between — sweetness and
sourness (wines > 45g/litres are sweet)
Chlorides : the amount of salt in the wine
Free.sulfur.dioxide : it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of
wine
Total.sulfur.dioxide : is the amount of free + bound forms of SO2
PH : the level of acidity
Sulphates: a wine additive that contributes to SO2 levels and acts as an
antimicrobial and antioxidant
Alcohol: the amount of alcohol in wine
Quality: the numeric label indicating quality of the wine sample ranging
from 3 to 8.
Density: sweeter wines have a higher density

## Algorithms used:
- Random Forest Classifier
- SVM

## Conclusion
In this project we have successfully implemented Wine Quality Prediction using
Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine Algorithm. Random
forest classifier and the support vector machine predict the quality of wine for a
record sample and determine which factor contributes maximum to the
prediction respectively. One of the biggest advantages of random forest is its
versatility. It can be used for both regression and classification tasks, and it's
also easy to view the relative importance it assigns to the input features.Support
vector machine works comparably well when there is an understandable margin
of dissociation between classes. It is more productive in high dimensional
spaces. It is effective in instances where the number of dimensions is larger than
the number of specimens.
